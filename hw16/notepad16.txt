what are the different ways to create objects?
=>There are different ways to create new objects:
Define and create a single object, using an object literal.
Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.

Using an Object Literal:
This is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Object
An object literal is a list of name:value pairs (like age:24) inside curly braces {}.
Example
var person = {firstName:"saikiran", lastName:"alli", age:24, eyeColor:"black"};

Using the JavaScript Keyword new
here objects are created are declared individually
for readability and execution speed use the object literal method
Example
var person = new Object();
person.firstName = "saikiran";
person.lastName = "alli";
person.age = 24;
person.eyeColor = "black";

Using an Object Constructor:
these helps to create many objects of one type.
Example
function person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
}
var myFather = new person("saikiran", "alli", 25, "black");
var myMother = new person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

In JavaScript, the thing called this, is the object that "owns" the JavaScript code.



what are properties in object?
=>A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.
Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.
propertyName and propertyValue pairs within object
properties are seperated by comma
propertyname and value are seperated by colon

The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:
objectName.property          // person.age
or
objectName["property"]       // person["age"]
or
objectName[expression]       // x = "age"; person[x]
Example: 
var text="hello world";
var textlength= text.length
document.write(textlength)   //result = 11
length property is used to determine the length of string


how to retrieve a property value in object?
=>The JavaScript for...in statement loops through the properties of an object.
The block of code inside of the for...in loop will be executed once for each property.
Looping through the properties of an object:
Syntax
for (variable in object) {
    code to be executed
}



how to add a property into object?
=>add property helps to add value tp the property
we can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.
we can give new properties to the existing object
To add a new property to an object, specify the object name followed by: a dot, the name of the new property, an equals sign, and the value for the new property (enclosed in quotes if it is a string)
syntax:
objectName.propertyName = value
objectName('propertyName') = value
Example
person.nationality = "English";



how to remove a property in object?
=>The delete keyword deletes a property from an object:
The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
After deletion, the property cannot be used before it is added back again.
Example
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
delete person.age;   // or delete person["age"]; 
syntax:
delete objectName.propertyName 
delete objectName('propertyName')

how to update a property value in object?
=>update property helps to push new values into the object
it gives a new list of objects with modiifed object
syntax:
objectName.propertyName = value
objectName('propertyName') = value


how to check if a property exists within an object?
=>The hasOwnProperty() method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property.
This method can be used to determine whether an object has the specified property 
syntax:
object.hasOwnProperty('propertyName')
-true -- then property exits
-false -- then property doesnot exits
