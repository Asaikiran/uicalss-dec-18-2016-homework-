1) what is  id, class, attribute, tagName selectors and differences between them, when to use what?
=>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
Each element can have only one id
Each page can have only one element with that id


The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class
we can use the same class on multiple elements.
we can use multiple classes on the same element.

The attribute selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

tagname selector selects tags by their name and apply styles on them
to implement tag selector, in place of selector, we write tagname
it selects every html tag with specified tag and applies styles on them


2) what is css Specificity? explain with all possible examples?
=>Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied.
Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector
When specificity is equal to any of the multiple declarations, the last declaration found in the CSS is applied to the elemen
Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted by multiple declaration


3)descendent selectors in css?
=>The descendant combinator — typically represented by a single space ( ) character
combines two selectors such that elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor element matching the first selector
Selectors that utilize a descendant combinator are called descendant selectors.
Syntax
selector1 selector2 { /* property declarations */ }


4) child selector in css?
=>The > combinator separates two selectors and matches only those elements matched by the second selector that are direct children of elements matched by the first
selector1 > selector2 { style properties }


5)adjacent sibling selectors in css?
This is referred to as an adjacent selector or next-sibling selector. 
It will select only the specified element that immediately follows the former specified element.
former_element + target_element { style properties }


6) multiple selectors in css? using , comma
=>the comma brings clarity—not code—to the separators. The comma in a CSS selector separates multiple selectors with the same styles.
By using commas between your selectors, we can create a more compact style sheet that’s easier to update in the future and that is easier to read. 


7)variations in attribute based selectors?
=>[attr]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr.
[attr=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is exactly "value".
[attr~=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words, one of which is exactly "value".
[attr|=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr. Its value can be exactly “value” or can begin with “value” immediately followed by “-” (U+002D). It can be used for language subcode matches.
[attr^=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose first value is prefixed by "value".
[attr$=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose last value is suffixed by "value".
[attr*=value]
Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value contains at least one occurrence of string "value" as substring.
[attr operator value i]
Adding an i (or I) before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-insensitively
